# Hello-world
This is my first repository which i have created with the purpose of learning GitHub.
I will include all the details here about all the procedures have to be followed for using GitHub.

# To create a new repository
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
2. Name your repository hello-world.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select *Initialize this repository with a README*.
5. Click Create repository.

# To create a new branch
1. Go to your new repository hello-world.
2. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
3. Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
4. Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

# Make and commit changes
1. Click the README.md file.
2. Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.

These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.

When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!
