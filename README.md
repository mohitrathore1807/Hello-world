# Hello-world
this is my first repository which i have created with the purpose of learning GitHub.
I will include all the details here about all the procedures have to be followed for using GitHub.

# To create a new repository
In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
Name your repository hello-world.
Write a short description.
Select *Initialize this repository with a README*.
Click Create repository.

# To create a new branch
Go to your new repository hello-world.
Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

# Make and commit changes
Click the README.md file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click Commit changes button.

These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.
